Things I was able to complete:
- created database
- seeded database
- database exhibits display on the welcome page
- created Edit and Create pages
- able to edit and create Exhibits
- added authentication
- pushed to Github
- deployed to Heroku
- links added to class notes page


Things I was not able to do:
- at the end of the day as I was working on
- delete isn't working
- no style whatsoever
- I don't know about the edit/create/delete for only authenticated users :(
- Many other things that I wasn't able to get to


Things of note:
I struggled with the routes/controllers quite a bit and that is what I got really hung up on.
I felt like I managed my time well but there were so many moments of confusion.
I was proud of myself for not letting my wheels spin for a really long time before seeking out
help. I really enjoyed the project and plan to continue working through it to make it better. Mine
just generally stinks right now.
